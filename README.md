# CS5530Project
Implementation for phase2 Eric Waugh and Jacob Sivo.
The database will print out options for the user that are pretty easy to follow.
You either create a user or login in with one in the first menu and then it brings up the options to do the rest.
Our system doesn't have many special things but we do sometimes tell the user we will force a certain value if they give bad input.
For our keywords they give 1 at a time and each word has its own wid so to insert 5 keywords you have to do 5 individually.
Some suggested users to use for our system would be login = 7 and password = 7, login = 2 and password = 2 and login = admin and password = admin.
The first two have the most info while the last one is a admin type to check the admin features.
